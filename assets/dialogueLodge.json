We have alot to show you here. \nYou will travel back to the Prehistoric Era with what you will witness today. \nHave some time to settle in and be ready to leave the Lodge soon for the tour!  \nAlso everyone, please keep in mind....  \nThis park is near and dear to me, so please treat it with respect.\nWith that said...\n<< introSpeechFinished >>\nWelcome everyone, to [color=#eef704]Jurrassic Park[/color]!  \nAnd you! Umm....  \nWhat was your name again?  \nYou know what forget it!\nI can't even remember half of the faces that I hire!\nI'll just call you [color=#eef704]Techy[/color].\nBeing the new technician, you are going to fix any electrical issues the park may encounter. \n[color=#eef704]Ed Regis[/color], with the [color=#eef704]sunglasses[/color], will give you a tour around the Lodge, where most of the operations take place. \nBefore you're off, make sure not to [color=#eef704]hurt[/color] any of MY [color=#eef704]dinosaurs[/color].\nIt is park property and costs alot of money. Anyways, welcome aboard the Jurassic Park team!",
