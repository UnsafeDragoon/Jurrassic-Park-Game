Umm....  \nWhat was your name again?  \nYou know what forget it!\nI can't even remember half of the faces that I hire!\nI'll just call you [color=#eef704]Techy[/color].\nBeing the new technician, you are going to fix any electrical issues the park may encounter. \n[color=#eef704]Ed Regis[/color], with the [color=#eef704]sunglasses[/color], will give you a tour around the Lodge, where most of the operations take place. \nBefore you're off, make sure not to [color=#eef704]hurt[/color] any of MY [color=#eef704]dinosaurs[/color].\nIt is park property and costs alot of money.
